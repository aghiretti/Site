## Alessandro Ghiretti | Phd Statistics

Statistician, data enthusiast, traveller and motorbike rider.

My name is Alessandro Ghiretti and I work as a Data Scientist in the Pharma sector.
After graduating in Marketing I obtained a Phd in Statistics where I got 
interested in robust statistics and outlier detection, time series analysis, econometrics, 
and machine learning. 

R is my computing choice but in the past I have also spent time playing with Matlab 
and Python.

In my free time I like traveling, riding my motorbike (KTM 790 adventure S),
listening music, reading and watching movies (Netflix addicted)
