After graduating in Marketing I obtained a Phd in Statistics where I got interested in time series analysis, econometrics, robust statistics and outlier detection and machine learning.\r\nR is my first choice as a programming language but in the past I have also spent time playing extensibvely with Matlab. I am a big Julia fan and I can not wait till it will overcome the other programming languages for data analysis and computation. (Ops I did not mention Pyhtonâ€¦SHAME ON ME!)\r\nWhile I am not working with data you can find me riding my motorbike (I am an happy KTM 790 Adventure owner) or spending time with my friends or my girlfriend.\r\nI als love travelling, reading and listening music (I listen pretty much everything).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
