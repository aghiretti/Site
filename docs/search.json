After graduating in Marketing I obtained a Phd in Statistics where I got interested in time series analysis, econometrics, robust statistics and outlier detection and machine learning.\r\nR is my computing choice but in the past I have also spent time playing with Matlab and Python.\r\nIn my free time I like traveling, riding my motorbike (KTM 790 adventure S), listening music, reading and watching movies (Netflix addicted)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
