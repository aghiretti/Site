## Alessandro Ghiretti

My name is Alessandro Ghiretti and I work as a Data Scientist.
After graduating in Marketing I obtained a Phd in Statistics where I got
interested in time series analysis, econometrics, robust statistics and outlier
detection and machine learning.


R is my first choice as a programming language but in the past I have also spent time playing extensibvely with Matlab. I am a big Julia fan and I can not wait till it will overcome the other programming languages for data analysis and computation.
(Ops I did not mention Pyhton...SHAME ON ME!)

While I am not working with data you can find me riding my motorbike (I am an happy KTM 790 Adventure owner) or spending time with my friends or my girlfriend.

I als love travelling, reading and listening music (I listen pretty much everything).
