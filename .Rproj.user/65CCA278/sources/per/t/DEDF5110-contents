## Alessandro Ghiretti | Phd Statistics

Statistician, enthusiat for traveling and motorbike riding, love for statistics

My name is Alessandro Ghiretti and I work as a Data Scientist.
After graduating in Marketing I obtained a Phd in Statistics where I got
interested in time series analysis, econometrics, robust statistics and outlier
detection and machine learning.

R is my computing choice but in the past I have also spent time playing with Matlab. 
I am a big Julia fan and sorry guys but I do not Python that much

In my free time I like traveling, riding my motorbike (KTM 790 adventure S),
listening music, reading a watching movies (Netflix addicted)
